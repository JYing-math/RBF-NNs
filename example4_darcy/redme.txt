The relative L2 error is computed over the domain [0,1]^3, and the PUA and SAIS methods load the results of the first training phase.


For the first training phase, the neural network architecture is configured as (3, 20, 1, 7), with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimizer adopted for 1000 epochs. A total of 10000 interior points and 600 boundary points are sampled for this initial training. The PUA, SAIS, ANNB and NURWAS methods are all trained using the identical network specifications and code is 3d_lm in RBF_LC .


For the RBF_LC method, the Adam optimizer is used. The neural network architecture is set to (3, 40, 1, 7), and the RBF function network structure is configured as (3, 80, 1). This training runs for 20000 epochs with 10000 interior points and 600 boundary points. The coefficient ε for controlling failure points is set to 10.3, and the coefficient eps_thresh for controlling failure regions is set to 0.05 and code is 3D_darcy_adam_failure in RBF_LC .


The PUA method uses the LM optimizer with 2000 epochs, 10000 initial interior points and 600 boundary points, with ε = 10.3 for controlling point selection.


The SAIS method adopts the LM optimizer with 2000 epochs, 10000 initial interior points and 600 boundary points, with tolerance_r—the parameter controlling calculation distribution—set to 0.1.


The NURWAS method employs the Adam optimizer with 20000 epochs, 10000 initial interior points and 600 boundary points, with a disturbance coefficient of 1/20.


For the ANNB method, the ANNB_2 variant uses 6001 basis functions in the main domain, with 6000 initial interior points and 3000 boundary points, a subdomain sphere radius of 0.2, a normal distribution standard deviation of 5, and only one iteration performed. The domain is divided into 9 subdomains which are solved simultaneously; each subdomain uses 101 basis functions, 300 initial interior points and 100 boundary points. The ANNB_1 variant is an iterative method that processes subdomains one by one, with all parameter settings kept consistent with those of ANNB_2.
