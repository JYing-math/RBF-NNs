This code is the verification of Theorem 5 to handle the elliptic interface problem. The initial learning rate of Adam is set to 1e-3 with 10000 iterations. The code provides two lists: mr_list = [100, 400, 1600, 6400] and n_hidden_list = [10, 20, 40, 80], which represent the list of points and the list of neurons respectively. Four groups of experiments are directly conducted with combinations (100, 10), (400, 20), (1600, 40), (6400, 80), and each group of experiments is cycled five times. Meanwhile, the code creates a process pool to accelerate the numerical experiments.
