The relative L2 error is computed over the domain [0,1]^3, and the PUA, SAIS, and NURWAS methods load the results of the first training phase.


For the first training phase, the neural network architecture is configured as (3, 30, 1, 3), with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimizer adopted for 1000 epochs. A total of 2000 interior points and 50 boundary points are sampled for this initial training. The PUA, SAIS, and ANNB methods are all trained using the identical network specifications and code in RBF_LC.


For the RBF LC the LM optimizer is used with 2000 epochs, 500 interior points, and 50 boundary pointsand ，the RBF function network structure is configured as (3, 80, 1). The coefficient ε for controlling failure points is set to 0.005 when Re = 50, other ε is 0.05, and the coefficient eps_thresh for controlling failure regions is set to 0.05.


The PUA method uses the LM optimizer with 2000 epochs, 500 initial interior points, and 50 boundary points, with ε = 0.05 for controlling point selection.


The SAIS method adopts the LM optimizer with 2000 epochs, 500 initial interior points, and 50 boundary points, with tolerance_r—the parameter controlling calculation distribution—set to 0.05.


The NURWAS method employs the Adam optimizer with 20000 epochs, 5000 initial interior points, and 300 boundary points, with a disturbance coefficient of 1/8.


For the ANNB method, 5001 basis functions are assigned per subdomain, with 8000 initial interior points, 3000 boundary points, a subdomain sphere radius of 0.1, only one iteration performed, and scaling coefficients constrained within the range of [0,10].
