The relative L2 error is computed over the domain [-0.2,0.2]^3 \ [0,0.2]^2 × [-0.2,0.2], and the PUA, SAIS and NURWAS methods load the results of the first training phase.


For the first training phase, the neural network architecture is configured as (3, 20, 1, 3), with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimizer adopted for 1000 epochs. A total of 4000 interior points and 400 boundary points are sampled for this initial training. The PUA, SAIS and ANNB methods are all trained using the identical network specifications and code in RBF_LC.


For the RBF_LC method, the LM optimizer is used with 1000 epochs,  and the RBF function network structure is configured as (3, 40, 1).1000 interior points and 100 boundary points. The coefficient ε for controlling failure points is set to 0.4, and the coefficient eps_thresh for controlling failure regions is set to 0.05.


The PUA method uses the LM optimizer with 2000 epochs, 4000 initial interior points and 400 boundary points, with ε = 0.4 for controlling point selection.


The SAIS method adopts the LM optimizer with 2000 epochs, 4000 initial interior points and 400 boundary points, with tolerance_r—the parameter controlling calculation distribution—set to 0.4.


The NURWAS method employs the Adam optimizer with 20000 epochs, 4000 initial interior points and 400 boundary points, with a disturbance coefficient of 1/2000.


For the ANNB method, 5001 basis functions are assigned per subdomain, with 8000 initial interior points, 5000 boundary points, a subdomain sphere radius of 0.1, only one iteration performed, and scaling coefficients constrained within the range of [5, 10].
